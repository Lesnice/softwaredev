What is Normalisation?
It is the process employed to organise data within a data base in order to reducing data redundancy and improve data integrity.
This is orchestrated by removing duplicates, ensuring dependencies are logical and making databases more efficient to manage.

Normalisation follows a series of steps known as normal forms each with particular rules and objectives.

First Normal Form(1NF)
Each table must contain atomic values and columns must be of the same data type.
objective is to remove duplicate columns from same table and create separate tables for related data

Second Normal Form(2NF)
Table must have passed the 1NF and all non-key columns dependent on primary key in a non-transitive manner
The objective is to remove partial dependencies that is, no non-key dependency should depend on a part of a composite key

Third Normal Form(3NF)

Table must be in 2NF, with all non-key coloumns non-transitively dependent on the primary key
The objective is to remove transitive dependencies that is non-key dependencies depending on other non-key dependncies.

Foreign Key?

A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. The purpose of a foreign key is to ensure referential integrity between the two tables. In other words, it establishes a link between the data in the two tables, 
ensuring that the data in the foreign key column matches data in the referenced table's primary key or unique key column.
